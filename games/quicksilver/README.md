**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
  A 2d roguelike like Enter the Gungeon, but a lot more emphasis on speed throughout the game.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Instead of a health mechanic, the player will have a timer to clear each floor. They lose time upon getting hit instead of health, and can gain time from enemies/clearing rooms. 

To keep up the frantic pace, the player will have a dash mechanic and will be encouraged to fight in close quarters with enemies in each room. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
There will be 3-4 floors, with an amount (not yet determined) of rooms a floor. the final room will be a bossfight, the other rooms may change run to run. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
A variety of enemies and weapons will hopefully keep playesr engaged and willing to keep trying to clear each floor of the dungeon.
